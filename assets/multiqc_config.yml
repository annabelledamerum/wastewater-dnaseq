  alpha_diversity:
    anchor: "Alpha_Diversity"
    parent_id: Diversity_Analysis
    parent_name: "Diversity Analysis"
    section_name: "Alpha Diversity"
    description: "Alpha diversity is a measurement of the microbial diversity of each group. For analyses with group comparison, a box-and-whisker plot of observed species in each group is shown. Alpha diversity computed by different metrics can be found by clicking on the dropdown menu to the left of the plot."
    parent_description: "In this section, alpha diversity, alpha rarefaction, and beta diversity results by group are displayed in each subsection. Samples may be removed from diversity analysis for low read counts (default: 10,000 reads) or if samples belong to groups that lack any other replicates." 

  alpha_rarefaction:
    anchor: "Alpha_Rarefaction"
    parent_id: Diversity_Analysis
    parent_name: "Diversity Analysis"
    section_name: "Alpha Rarefaction"
    description: "This section shows an interactive alpha rarefaction plot, which is the alpha diversity (species richness) as a function of the sampling depth (sequencing read counts). Rarefaction is a technique to correct for uneven sampling when performing diversity analyses. Rarefaction curves can help to identify if sampling depth is sufficient to capture the true diversity of the community. Rarefaction curves are generated by randomly subsampling sequencing reads over a range of values and determining the alpha diversity at each read depth (at an average of 5 iterations). Curves computed by different metrics can be found by clicking on the dropdown menu to the left of the plot."

  beta_diversity:
    anchor: "beta_diversity"
    parent_id: Diversity_Analysis
    parent_name: "Diversity Analysis"
    section_name: "Beta Diversity"
    description: "Beta diversity is a measurement of microbial diversity differences between samples. The figure below is the 3-dimensional principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot created using Bray-Curtis or Jaccard dissimilarity to calculate a matrix of paired-wise distances between samples. Use the dropdown menus below to access interactive 3-dimensional plots of beta diversity with different matrices. Each dot on the beta diversity plot represents the whole microbial composition profile. Samples with similar microbial composition profiles are closer to each other, while samples with different profiles are farther away from each other."

  comparative_alpha_rarefaction:
    anchor: "comparative_alpha_rarefaction"
    parent_id: Comparative_Diversity_Analysis
    parent_name: "Comparative Diversity Analysis"
    parent_description: "In this section, a comparative diversity analysis has been conducted using the selected reference dataset. All diversity analyses have been recomputed to include the reference dataset, so results may appear differently than in the <a href='#Diversity_Analysis'>Diversity Analysis</a> section. Please note that comparisons across different studies should be interpreted with caution, as many different factors from sample collection, DNA isolation, library preparation and sequencing can impact the results obtained. We always try to use the original group labels for comparisons to the reference dataset. However, when original group labels are not provided or lack the replicates required for this comparison, we use 'user-samples' as the new group label for all user samples."
    section_name: "Alpha Rarefaction"
    description: "This section shows an interactive alpha rarefaction plot, which is the alpha diversity (species richness) as a function of the sampling depth (sequencing read counts), drawn from user and reference data. Reference data can be distinguished from your own data by the prefix `Ref_` added to group names, displayed in the legend to the right of the plot. Curves computed by different metrics can be found by clicking on the dropdown menu to the left of the plot."
